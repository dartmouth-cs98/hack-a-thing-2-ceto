#### Short Description of What Was Built
- The goal of this project was to learn more about the Google Calendar integration which we plan to use for our project
- We are using Google's Calendar API to connect to an account that a user logs into and then import that information
- Ultimately our plan will be to import this data as well as any other calendars and find available meeting times for users
