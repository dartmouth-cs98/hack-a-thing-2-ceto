#### Short Description of What Was Built
- The goal of this project was to learn more about the Google Calendar integration which we plan to use for our project
- We are using Google's Calendar API to connect to an account that a user logs into and then import that information
- Ultimately our plan will be to import this data as well as any other calendars and find available meeting times for users
---
#### What Description of What Was Learned
- I learned more about how Google's Calendar API works and believe I will be able to implement this in our application
---
#### What Didn't Work
- It took me awhile to get used to the flow of web development, which ate up a decent amount of time
- I had some trouble authenticating everything, but think I got to a point where it is all settled
